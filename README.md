# car-managerV2.0

What should this program do?

Idea is simple: Everything about your car/cars available on your cell phone or computer at every hour.
If you need a reminder to change oil, filters or maybe you forgot to pay your insurance or vignette, this program
will announce you every time, one week before due.
From now on if you go to a car service, you will know exactly when and where did you exchanged parts at your
car directly from your phone.

Future ideas for program:
-I want to add a map for every important point for your car around your house. Ex: Gas Station, Car Service, etc.
-Fuel Consumption. Based on information written on program, calculate Fuel consumption and announce you if
your car starts to consume to much.
-Investments. Based on information given to program it should give you an analyze on how much money did you
spend on car each year/month.
